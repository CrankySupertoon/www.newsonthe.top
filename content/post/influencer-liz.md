Sai Chauhan often complains that his brother Neel should be an "influencer"
rather than an software engineer, and wooes Neel with the fact that he could be
"rich and famous" and "change lives".

Well, [underground pop singer LIZ Y2K said the following to Hunger TV](https://www.hungertv.com/editorial/let-liz-be-your-internet-guide/):

> The worst accounts would have to be influencers who are only famous for being friends with other famous people, who then do nothing useful or meaningful with their platforms.

That's right: "influencers" just show off the fact that they're famous and do
nothing. Yes, *nothing*.

This is in comparison to other celebrities who give a reason for their fame,
whether movies, music, books, products, or politics.

Also related, it is known that
[social media and television, but not video games](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/social-media-mental-health-screen-time-instagram-facebook-video-games-study-1.5211782)
is linked to depression in teens. So yes, "influencers change lives" **for the
worse**.
