Jake Paul revealed earlier today that he uses Opera as his web browser in a
tweet.

The relvation of his browser use is unsurprising since he revealed this
[last month to NewsOnTheTop](/post/jake-paul-opera/), however now this is
public.

We expect Opera's market share to jump.

Opera is considering using other "influencers" on YouTube, Instagram, and
TikTok to sponsor Opera. Jake Paul is also in the process of making a video
sponsored by Opera.
