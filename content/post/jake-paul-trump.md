Jake Paul recently posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tE5YUxzDYE)
where he endorses Donald Trump for 2020's presidential election. In the said
video, Paul wears a Make America Great Again hat and shares Pepe the Frog memes.

Paul says voting for Trump is necessary to "turn the United States into an
economic superpower" and that "Trump is the greatest president to live".

Paul says if declared 'socialists' win the presidency, "they will ruin what
made America great in the first place".

Both Paul and Trump have been controversal figures, often turning to
sensationalization for attention, publically being racist, and putting down
their rivals.

We expect Trump's poll ratings to rise in revelation of this video. We also
expect Jake Paul's viewer base to expand into the far-right political spectum.
