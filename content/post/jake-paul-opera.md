title: "Jake Paul: A True Jake Pauler uses Opera"

In an private email to NewsOnTheTop, Jake Paul said that if one truly loves
Jake Paul, they use Opera as their one and only web browser. Recaps of the
email will be shown here.

# "100% Scandinavian"

Jake Paul has mentioned that unlike other browsers which are mostly made in
"third-world" countries like the United States and China, Opera is made using
"100% Scandinavian Engineering" in Norway. He denies that Opera is based on the
Chromium web browser which is made by an American company.

When confronted about Opera's founder creating [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/),
Paul claims that Vivaldi was not created by Opera's founder and that Vivaldi is
another "wannabe" web browser made in China, without realizing that Vivaldi
(the browser) is also Scandinavian.

# Features

Jake Paul says Opera has many innovative features such as a free VPN, ad
blocker, cryptocurrency wallet, and battery saver that once users start to use,
they'd never look at any other browser.

He doesn't relize that most of those "features" can be done with add-ons to
browsers such as Chrome and Firefox, and that Opera doesn't add anything unique
to the table. When was the last time someone copied an Opera feature?

He also mentioned Opera has a special Opera GX edition which is necessary for
every gamer, with features such as CPU and RAM limiting, unique wallpapers,
built-in Twitch client, and Razer Chroma integration. He denies these features
in reality have little to no use, as most gamers are happy with Chrome which
lacks most of Opera's "features".

# Customizability

Jake Paul says Opera is the most "customizable" web browser as mentioned in
the quote below:

> opera is so customizable: chrome extensions support, speed dial, dark mode, backgrounds, and GX razer chroma, nothing beats opera.

When confronted with Opera losing customization features with the transition to
Chromium, or that competing browsers like Vivaldi and Firefox have more
customization features, Paul's response mentioned Opera's wide feature set.

# Summary

Jake Paul has not mentioned whether or not he was sponsored by Opera, but like
many "influencers", we assume he is. His email sounded a lot like paid
advertising.

Paul has also not mentioned whether he would make his support for Opera public
with his followers.
