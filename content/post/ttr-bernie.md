It's official: The Toontwon Rewritten team has endorsed Bernie Sanders for the
2020 Democratic primary.

In an [exclusive interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgGzAKP_HuM),
TTR's leader Joey Ziolkowski says "Bernie is the only person who can
effectively run America as well as Toontown." Ziolkowski has emphasized that
"Toons have homes, food, and free healthcare. It's time Americans have that
also," criticizing Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Republican congressmen like
Mitch McConnel and Kevin McCarthy while praising US congresswomen Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar.

However, the TTR people don't realize that Biden has a 300 delegate lead over
Bernie. It is very likely that Biden would be the 2020 Democratic nominee,
but a change in events could still happen.
