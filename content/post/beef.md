If you read the "mainstream" news, you are usually told that people in the
finance and technology industries have the best job prospects. Well, they
couldn't be more wrong.

If you want to be set for the future, look no further than the red meat
industry.

# Always in Demand

The stock market will go up and down. It will crash and rebound. Technologies
change in paradigm shifts. But the need for food never changes.

And if you fall into the hype of "Beyond Meat" and the other fake "meats",
you're setting yourself up for failure.

# Beef Is Good For You

Unlike the "scientists" who are paid for by PETA supporters and Hindus to claim
red meat is "bad for you", red meat is in fact fantastic for you.

Red meat has a lot of protein that you *need*. In fact,
[WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/men/features/benefits-protein) says the following:

> Protein is an important component of every cell in the body. ... Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues. You also use protein to make enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.

If you want to promote the physical wellbeing of people, raise beef and
encourage people to eat it. Red meats also are essential for the growth of
children.

# Part of American Culture

Red Meat is part of American culture. Why be a vegan priced out of your NYC or
San Fran apartment and always in debt when you could thrive on a red meat diet
living in a Southern or Midwestern suburb? You'll have more money to save, to
have kids and ultimately raise a new generation of Americans.

Why fight American culture when you can *embrace* it? Just raise cattle for
your neighbors' nutritious meals.

# Ethical and Natural

If you listen to "vegan" propaganda, they tell you that killing animals for
food is "unethical". Well, look at carnivores, they eat other animals. It's
part of nature, just accept it.

If a lion or coyote eats other animals, if your pet dog needs to eat other
animals, then why can't you? It's just natural, right?

And with technology, you can raise a farm of cattle for food cheaply and
efficiently. Or you can go natural and free-range.

# Well Paid

Being a beef rancher is well paying, since you're your own boss. Need more
money? Just raise more cattle to get more beef out of them, and make rest
have children so they can be eaten also.

Why be a "hipster" coding a stupid "app" at a "startup" when you could grow
food? Heck, the only reason we have an economy is to eat food and have
children, we just made the economy too complex with "technology" and
"government".

# Conclusion

Instead of trying to be a finance or computer science major to work at yet
another bank or "tech" firm, or failing to make a living on crappy "social
media" posts that get forgotten, don't even go to college and instead start
raising cattle out of high school.

You get money immediately, and not only that, your income can go higher unlike
being say a janitor at an office, just raise more cattle and expand your farm.
No more worrying about student debt ever!

And what else? Americans *love* their meats, so don't listen to radical Hindu
or PETA propaganda saying otherwise.
