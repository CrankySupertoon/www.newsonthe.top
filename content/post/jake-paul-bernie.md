Jake Paul recently posted [a vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pScpXs7Ysdg)
where he mentioned that Bernie Sanders' primary victory in New Hampshire is
"depressing". He says a victory of Elizabeth Warren would be "equally awful."

Paul says "Bernie will destroy what America stands for: freedom, capitalism,
small government, everything that has been built in the last 250 years."

"Bernie could win the presidency this way", Paul emphasizes, "turning America
into Venezuela or Zimbabwe". Paul mentioned "Bernie will make it harder for
me to make videos since he will take 70% of my income as 'taxes'".

Paul also made racist remarks about US Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
and Ilhan Omar and wanted them to get "deported", showing deepfaked videos of
their 'arrest'.

The said video at the time of writing has 666 dislikes and only 69 likes. It
also has 420 comments, one saying:

> so you support the trade war, locking up miagrant kids, and taking away our healthcare? i'm unsubscribing and burning my jake paul merch in acid

We expect Jake Paul to transition into a 'alt-right' YouTuber and alienate his
[Vine](https://www.winehq.org/) fanbase.
