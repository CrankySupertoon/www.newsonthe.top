title: "BREAKING: Sai Chauhan caught using Firefox"

An anonymous student from Amherst College caught Sai Chauhan, a transgender
man, using Firefox on his laptop and phone.

Sai slaims to use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) as his primary web browser,
claiming it's the most "customizable" browser. It is likely he's paid to
promote Vivaldi by pretending to "use" it in public. This is not unlike many
celebrities who are paid to promote Beats headphones in music videos but
actually use something else at home and in the studio.

The relevation that Sai uses Firefox shows Vivaldi is not as advanced as it
claims to be. Most of Vivaldi's customization features are available in other
browsers such as Firefox. For instance, Firefox was always a hevaily
customizable and extendable browser, and
[still is](https://www.howtogeek.com/333110/how-to-customize-firefox-quantum-and-remove-the-white-space-around-the-title-bar/)
to this date.
